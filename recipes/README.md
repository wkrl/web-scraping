# Recipes Web Scrape

Web scraping recipes categorized by meal type. Each recipe comes with title, url, rating, image url, instructions and ingredients properties. 

## Getting started

Change the parameter of `get_recipes()` in order to scrape as many pages as you like. 
Run the script `recipes.py`. It will output the result as a .json file. 

## Motivation

I was trying to build a cooking app with React.js. When searching for recipe / cooking API's I couldn't find a lot. Also, most if not all of them weren't free and some even falsy advertised that they were.
